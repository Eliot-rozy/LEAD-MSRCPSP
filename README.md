# LEAD-MSRCPSP Prompt Templates (Supplementary Material)

This repository provides the prompt templates used in our paper:

**LEAD-MSRCPSP: LLM-empowered Automatic Design of Heuristic Methods for Multi-Skill Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems**

The goal of this repository is to make the prompts **copyable, inspectable, and version-controlled** for reproducibility. It contains:
- Plain-text prompt templates (recommended for reuse)
- The corresponding figures used in the paper appendix (for reference)
